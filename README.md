# ABIA-Azamon
This project solves a package-to-offer assignment problem using local search. We implement state representation, operators, heuristics, and initial solution strategies, and compare Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing through extensive experiments to minimize cost and analyze happiness–cost trade-offs.
